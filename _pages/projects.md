1. National Science Foundation of China “**Research on Intelligent Cognition and Efficient Dispatch and Control of Generalized Loads**.” (2021-present, main graduate participants)

- Conducted research on the "Flexibility Assessment of Generalized Load Controllability"
- Proposed the reference aggregation model and quantitative metric system for flexible energy resources, including DERs in the power system, gas, and heat networks. The reference aggregation model offers a distinct physical interpretation and facilitates the calculation of quantitative metrics
- Developed the “Data-Driven Distribution EMS (D3EMS)” platform to validate our proposed methodologies

2. China Southern Power Grid Company Lmt Technology Project “**Optimal Dispatch and Operation of Virtual Power Plants Comprising Distributed Energy Resources**.” (2018-2021, main graduate participants)

- Proposed a high-accuracy aggregation method for evaluating power flexibility and aggregating cost functions in a VPP
- Aggregated distributed energy resouces including electric vehicle charging piles, distributed photovoltatics, distribued energy storage devices, and controllable loads 
- Developed the software "Intelligent Energy Management and Virtual Power Plant Operation System by Aggregating Distributed Sources," capable of managing DERs in VPP format. It assists VPP operators in aggregating DER flexibility and formulating bidding strategies for the energy and auxiliary service market. Post market clearance, the system can disaggregate VPP dispatch orders. 
- Software platform implemented in the China Southern Grid of Guangdong Province.

3. National Key Research and Development Program 1.3 “**Regional High-Penetration Distributed Power Generation Clusters with Flexible Grid Integration, Group Control, and Group Regulation Technology**.” (2018-2019, main graduate participants)

- Designed a hierarchical energy management system for the active distribution network, comprising three levels: distributed cluster control, optimal distribution grid dispatch, and coordinated operation of transmission and distribution
- Proposed a multi-timescale dispatch framework, including day-ahead dispatch, intra-day rolling dispatch, and real-time dispatch to reconcile the conflict between economic efficiency and security
- Developed the active power dispatch module to regulate numerous photovoltaics and energy storage devices in the software "Energy Management and Cluster Control System for Active Distribution Networks to Accommodate Massive Distributed Photovoltaics," implemented in Jinzhai, Anhui Province
- Awarded Golden Medal in the International Exhibition of Inventions Geneva in 2022- 

4. National Key Research and Development Program 4.3 “**Key Techniques of Adaptive Grid Integration and Active Synchronization for Extremely High Distributed Photovoltaic Power Penetration Generation**.” (2022-present, main graduate participants)

- Conducted research to characterize the interdependent capability of clusters for active support in the operational safety domain
- Optimally allocated active support capabilities of photovoltaic clusters within feasible ranges
- Introduced an assessment method for the feasibility domain of active-reactive power regulation to facilitate the active synchronization of clusters. Development of the software platform is ongoing
