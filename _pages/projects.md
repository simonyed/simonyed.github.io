1. National Science Foundation of China “**Research on Intelligent Cognition and Efficient Dispatch and Control of Generalized Loads**.” (2021-present, main graduate participants)
* Conducted research on the "Flexibility Assessment of Generalized Load Controllability" and proposed the reference aggregation model and quantitative metric system for flexible energy resources, encompassing distributed energy resources in the power system, gas and heat network. Developed the “Data-Driven Distribution EMS (D3EMS)” platform to validate our proposed methodologies.

2. National Key Research and Development Program 1.3 “**Regional High-Penetration Distributed Power Generation Clusters with Flexible Grid Integration, Group Control, and Group Regulation Technology**.” (2018-2019, main graduate participants)
* Developed the software “Energy Management and Cluster Control System for Active Distribution Networks to Accommodate Massive Distributed Photovoltaics.” and implemented in the State Grid of Anhui Province.

3. National Key Research and Development Program 4.3 “**Key Techniques of Adaptive Grid Integration and Active Synchronization for Extremely High Distributed Photovoltaic Power Penetration Generation**.” (2022-present, main graduate participants)
* Proposed an assessment method for the feasibility domain of active-reactive power regulation to facilitate the active synchronization of clusters.

4. China Southern Power Grid Company Lmt Technology Project “**Optimal Dispatch and Operation of Virtual Power Plants Comprising Distributed Energy Resources**.” (2018-2021, main graduate participants)
* Developed the software “Intelligent Energy Management and Virtual Power Plant Operation System by Aggregating Distributed Sources and Flexible Loads.” and implemented in the China Southern Grid of Guangdong Province.
