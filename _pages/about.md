I am in the final year of doctoral studies in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University, supervised by [Prof. Wenchuan Wu](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/wuwench.htm), scheduled to graduate in June 2024. My research interests include mathematical optimization, machine learning algorithms, and their applications in energy system operation and coordination. Specifically, my doctoral dissertation focuses on the flexibility evaluation of diverse energy resources, including the aggregation of distributed energy resources in a virtual power plant, the assessment of equivalent energy storage flexibility in gas and heat networks, and the aggregation of flexibility in regional power grids for the coordinated dispatch of interconnected systems. Additionally, I explore cloud-edge collaborative agile control of distributed energy resources and physics-embedded RNN for the identification of gas pipeline network parameters. I received the Tsinghua University Jiang Nanxiang Principal Scholarship, a prestigious honor granted to only 20 graduate students annually
