I am in the final year of doctoral studies in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University, supervised by [Prof. Wenchuan Wu](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/wuwench.htm), scheduled to graduate in June 2024. My research interests include mathematical optimization, machine learning algorithms, and their applications in energy system operation and coordination. Specifically, my doctoral dissertation focuses on the flexibility evaluation of diverse energy resources, including the aggregation of distributed energy resources in a virtual power plant, the assessment of equivalent energy storage flexibility in gas and heat networks, and the aggregation of flexibility in regional power grids for the coordinated dispatch of interconnected systems. Additionally, I explore cloud-edge collaborative agile control of distributed energy resources and physics-embedded RNN for the identification of gas pipeline network parameters. I received the Tsinghua University Jiang Nanxiang Principal Scholarship, a prestigious honor granted to only 20 graduate students annually, in addition to the National Scholarship.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
