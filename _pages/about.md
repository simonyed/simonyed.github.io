I am in the final year of doctoral studies in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University, supervised by [Prof. Wenchuan Wu](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/wuwench.htm), scheduled to graduate in June 2024. My research focuses on mathematical optimization, AI algorithms, and their applications in the operation and coordination of power system and multi-energy systems. 

Through active involvement in academic research and technical projects, I have acquired a solid foundation in mathematics optimization and machine learning theory and possess strong programming skills. I proficient in the C/C++, Python, and MATLAB programming languages, and experienced in utilizing the PyTorch AI framework, along with CPLEX and Gurobi optimizers. The software I developed has successfully undergone on-site application testing in 5 regional power systems of China. 

I received the Tsinghua University Jiang Nanxiang Principal Scholarship in 2023, a prestigious honor granted to only 20 graduate students in Tsinghua Univeristy annually.
